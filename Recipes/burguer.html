    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground beef (80% lean)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
      <li>Cheese slices (optional)</li>
      <li>Lettuce, tomato, pickles, and other toppings (optional)</li>
    </ul>  
    <br>
    <p>And after you gather all the ingredients, the last thing is to just follow these steps.</p>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
      <li>In a bowl, combine ground beef, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, salt, and Worcestershire sauce. Mix gently until just combined.</li>
      <li>Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape each into a patty, making a slight indentation in the center of each.</li>
      <li>Grill or cook the patties for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness.</li>
      <li>If adding cheese, place a slice on each patty during the last minute of cooking to melt.</li>
      <li>Toast the hamburger buns lightly on the grill or in a skillet.</li>
      <li>Assemble the burger by placing the patty on the bottom bun, then adding any desired toppings like lettuce, tomato, and pickles.</li>
      <li>Top with the other half of the bun, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
