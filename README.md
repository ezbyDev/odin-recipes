This project is the first one in TOPs curriculum. It's meant to show if I've learned all the concepts before this project, that being basic "Git" usage and most about common "HTML".

I'll update this with my progress and thoughts once I finish the project. I expect to do it in less than an Hour since it doesn't include anything complex, but I have to do it from memory.

Update:

It's been easy but a good learning and taste exercise, meaning that I've understood how to better layout the website in basic HTML, and I hope that'll help when going back to add CSS.
